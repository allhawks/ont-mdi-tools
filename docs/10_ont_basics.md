Detailed descriptions of Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) methods and
data types is beyond the scope of these instructions, but well documented
by ONT elsewhere:

- ONT on GitHub: <https://github.com/nanoporetech>
- POD5 files and utility: <https://github.com/nanoporetech/pod5-file-format>
- Dorado basecaller: <https://github.com/nanoporetech/dorado>
- Remora modification modeleing: <https://github.com/nanoporetech/remora>

A high-level overview of nanopore sequencing is provided by many reviews, including our structural variant review:
